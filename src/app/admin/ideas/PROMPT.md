# 💡 Ideas Page — LLM Prompt Guide

## What This Feature Does
The Ideas page is the **entry point** of the Pimlico XHS content pipeline. It captures regulatory and market data ideas — topics, angles, enforcement actions, market trends — that will be developed into full articles.

Ideas flow: **Ideas → Drafting → Collateral → Copy → Publishing**

## What I Need From You (User Input)
When I give you a topic, regulation, enforcement action, or market trend, generate an idea entry with these fields:

1. **Title** — A clear, specific headline (max 120 chars). Include the regulation name, jurisdiction, and angle.
2. **Description** — 2-4 sentences explaining the angle, why it matters, key points to cover, and any sources.
3. **Priority** — One of: `high` | `medium` | `low`
   - **High**: Breaking enforcement actions, new legislation entering force, urgent consultations closing soon
   - **Medium**: Ongoing regulatory developments, market trends, implementation updates
   - **Low**: Background research, opinion pieces, evergreen content
4. **Tags** — Select from these categories:
   - `AI Regulation`, `Payments`, `Gambling`, `Crypto`, `Cross-sector`
   - `Enforcement Action`, `New Legislation`, `Consultation`, `Market Trend`, `Opinion Piece`
5. **Notes** — Source links, references, related articles, or additional context.

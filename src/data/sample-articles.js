## Overview of Finland's New Gambling Act

Finland is undergoing a major transformation in its gambling regulatory landscape. The new Gambling Act, set to take effect in 2026, introduces a licensing system that will allow private operators to offer betting and online casino games in the Finnish market for the first time.

## End of the Veikkaus Monopoly

For decades, Finland maintained a state monopoly on gambling through Veikkaus, the national gambling operator. The new legislation marks a historic shift by:

- Opening the market to licensed private operators
- Maintaining strict regulatory oversight
- Preserving responsible gambling protections

## Key Licensing Requirements

### Operator Requirements

Companies seeking a Finnish gambling license must demonstrate:

- **Financial Stability**: Minimum capital requirements and proof of financial viability
- **Technical Competence**: Robust IT infrastructure and security measures
- **Responsible Gambling Commitment**: Comprehensive player protection programs
- **AML/KYC Compliance**: Strong anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures

### License Categories

The new framework includes separate licenses for:

| License Type | Scope | Duration |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Online Casino | Digital slot games, table games | 5 years |
| Sports Betting | Online and land-based betting | 5 years |
| Poker | Online poker rooms and tournaments | 5 years |

## Timeline for Implementation

- **Q1 2026**: Licensing applications open
- **Q2 2026**: First licenses expected to be granted
- **Q3 2026**: Licensed operators can begin operations
- **2027**: Full market transition complete

## Compliance Considerations

### Advertising Restrictions

Finland will implement strict advertising rules:

- No advertising to minors
- Mandatory responsible gambling messaging
- Restrictions on bonus promotions
- Social media advertising guidelines

### Player Protection Measures

Licensed operators must implement:

1. **Deposit Limits**: Mandatory player-set deposit limits
2. **Self-Exclusion**: National self-exclusion register integration
3. **Reality Checks**: Session time reminders
4. **Loss Limits**: Tools for players to limit losses

### Taxation

The new licensing regime includes:

- Gaming revenue tax structure
- Corporate tax obligations
- Contributions to responsible gambling funds

## Impact on Operators

### Opportunities

- Access to a new regulated market with high consumer spending
- Clear regulatory framework providing legal certainty
- Potential for innovation in gaming products

### Challenges

- Strict compliance requirements
- Competition with established operators
- Need for localized responsible gambling programs

## Conclusion

Finland's new Gambling Act represents a significant opportunity for operators willing to meet rigorous regulatory standards. Early preparation for licensing requirements will be essential for success in this newly opened market.

## Introduction

The EU AI Act represents the most comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence ever enacted. As of 2026, its provisions are entering into force in phases, with significant implications for regulated entities in financial services, gambling, and payments.

## Key Requirements for Regulated Entities

### Risk Classification

The AI Act introduces a risk-based classification system:

- **Unacceptable Risk**: AI systems that pose clear threats to safety, livelihoods, and rights are banned
- **High Risk**: AI systems in critical areas require strict compliance measures
- **Limited Risk**: AI systems with transparency obligations
- **Minimal Risk**: Most AI systems fall into this category with no specific obligations

### Compliance Timeline

| Milestone | Date | Requirements |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| Prohibited AI | February 2025 | Ban on unacceptable risk systems |
| General Purpose AI | August 2025 | GPAI model requirements |
| High-Risk Systems | August 2026 | Full compliance required |

## Implementation Steps

1. **AI System Inventory**: Catalog all AI systems in use across your organization
2. **Risk Assessment**: Classify each system according to the Act's risk categories
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas requiring remediation
4. **Documentation**: Prepare technical documentation and conformity assessments
5. **Governance**: Establish AI governance frameworks and oversight mechanisms

## Financial Services Considerations

For financial services firms, many AI applications will fall into the high-risk category, including:

- Credit scoring and lending decisions
- Insurance pricing and claims assessment
- Fraud detection systems
- Investment advisory tools

## Gambling Sector Implications

Gambling operators using AI must pay particular attention to:

- Player risk profiling systems
- Responsible gambling intervention tools
- Marketing and personalization algorithms
- Anti-money laundering AI systems

## Payments Industry Impact

Payment service providers should focus on:

- Transaction monitoring AI
- KYC and customer onboarding automation
- Fraud prevention systems
- Risk assessment tools

## Conclusion

The EU AI Act presents both challenges and opportunities for regulated entities. Early preparation and a systematic approach to compliance will be essential for navigating this new regulatory landscape.
